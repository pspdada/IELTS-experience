## One-Month IELTS Preparation Guide | From Zero to Passing Score

[中文](/README.md) | **English**

</div>

This is a full record and reflection of my IELTS preparation and exam experience in September 2025.

**Background**: I didn’t systematically study English during university, passing CET-4 (621) and CET-6 (560) without dedicated preparation. After that, I had little exposure to English for years. Due to application requirements, I decided to take the IELTS with only one month of preparation—while balancing a full-time job. I opted for the computer-based test and successfully achieved my target score (Overall 7.0, with all band scores meeting requirements).

| Section | Listening | Reading | Writing | Speaking | Overall | CEFR Level |
| ------- | --------- | ------- | ------- | -------- | ------- | ---------- |
| Score   | 8.0       | 8.5     | 6.5     | 5.5      | 7.0     | C1         |

In this guide, I share my preparation strategy, recommended resources, section-specific techniques, real exam insights, and common pitfalls to avoid. The focus is on **practical efficiency**, not chasing perfection—ideal for learners with limited time, decent foundational skills, and a target band of 6.5–7.0.

📌 **Key topics include**:

- How to plan and improve efficiently within one month
- High-ROI strategies for Listening, Reading, Writing, and Speaking
- Computer-based vs. Paper-based: Which to choose?
- Exam-day tips and honest reflections
- Encouragement and direction for those in the final stretch
