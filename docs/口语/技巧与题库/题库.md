### **自然之地**

Describe a natural place (e.g. park, mountain)

You should say:

Where this place is

How you knew this place

What it is like

And explain why you like to visit it

---

Yeah, so there’s this amazing place I really love visiting — it’s called the **Dongxiyong coastline**, which is one of the most beautiful and classic coastal hiking routes in Shenzhen. It’s famous for its stunning combination of mountains and sea views, with clear blue water and bright skies that totally wash away the noise and stress of city life.

I first heard about this place from one of my friends, who’s really into hiking. He told me it’s about four kilometers long, with half of the route going through mountain trails and the other half along the coastline. I decided to give it a try last year, and honestly, it was one of the best outdoor experiences I’ve ever had.

The scenery there is absolutely gorgeous — you can see the endless ocean stretching out in front of you, and behind you are green mountains covered in lush trees. Although the whole hike is quite challenging, there are several resting spots along the way. I remember stopping at one where someone was playing guitar and singing, and people just sat around enjoying the music and the sea breeze. It was such a relaxing and cozy moment.

One of the reasons I like visiting Dongxiyong is that it gives me a perfect break from the fast-paced city life. Whenever I go there, I feel completely refreshed and recharged. Also, it’s a great way to connect with nature and spend some peaceful time with friends.

---

### Q1. What kind of people like to visit natural places?

**结构：Responding + Reasons + Example**

Well, I think people who enjoy peace and outdoor activities usually like visiting natural places.

Because spending time in nature allows them to escape from the noisy city life and feel more relaxed.

For example, people who love hiking or photography often go to mountains or beaches to recharge and find inspiration.

---

### Q2. What are the differences between a natural place and a city?

**结构：Responding + 4W1H + Reasons**

A natural place is usually quiet, clean, and full of greenery, while a city is more crowded and noisy.

In nature, people can breathe fresh air and see beautiful landscapes, but in the city, life is faster and more stressful.

Because of these differences, many people visit natural places to find balance in their busy lives.

---

### Q3. Do you think that going to the park is the only way to get close to nature if you live in a city?

**结构：Responding + Reasons + Example**

Not really. Going to the park is one way, but there are many other options.

For example, people can grow plants at home, visit nearby lakes, or take short weekend trips to the countryside.

These small things also help people connect with nature and feel calm even when they live in big cities.

---

### Q4. Are there any wild animals in the city?

**结构：Responding + 4W1H + Example**

Yes, there are some wild animals even in big cities.

For instance, you can often see birds, squirrels, and stray cats in parks or residential areas.

Sometimes, in cities near forests or mountains, people might even spot wild boars or foxes.

It’s quite surprising but also reminds us that humans and animals share the same environment.

---

### Q5. Do you think it is a good idea to let animals stay in local parks for people to visit?

**结构：Responding + Reasons + Feelings & Reactions**

I think it can be a good idea if the animals are treated well and their safety is protected.

Because it allows people, especially children, to learn more about nature and respect wildlife.

But if the animals are kept just for entertainment, it might make me feel a bit uncomfortable, since they should live freely in their natural habitats.

---

### Q6. What can people gain from going to natural places?

**结构：Responding + Reasons + Feelings & Reactions + Example**

People can gain both physical and mental benefits from visiting natural places.

It helps them relax, clear their minds, and improve their mood after stressful work.

For example, hiking in the mountains or walking along the beach gives me a sense of peace and freedom that I can’t find in the city.

The hiking route is around **four kilometers long**, with the first half going through green mountain paths and the second half following the rocky coastline.

I discovered this talent during my first long hike along the Dongxiyong coastline in Shenzhen last year. Although I managed to complete the trail, I realized that I could improve my power and overall fitness to make hiking more enjoyable and less exhausting.

To improve this talent, I plan to **train regularly** by jogging, doing strength exercises, and gradually attempting longer and more challenging trails. I also want to learn more about proper hiking techniques and how to pace myself efficiently. By doing this, I hope to enhance both my physical endurance and my ability to enjoy nature more fully.

I feel really **excited and motivated** about improving this talent because hiking gives me a sense of freedom and relaxation.

The special thing I waited for was a concert ticket for *Imagine Dragons*, which is one of my all-time favorite bands. I had been hoping to see them perform live for years, so when I heard they were finally going to have a concert in Shenzhen this year, I was beyond excited.

Actually, I’d been waiting for this opportunity for several years, ever since I first started listening to their songs in high school. When the tickets were released, they sold out almost immediately, which was really frustrating. But I didn’t give up — I kept checking the ticket app every few days, hoping that someone might refund their ticket. After waiting for a few weeks, I finally managed to buy one during the resale period, and luckily, it was exactly the seat I wanted.

It was so special for me because I’ve loved *Imagine Dragons* since I was a kid. Their music is not only popular but also really powerful and uplifting. Many of their songs talk about courage and self-belief, which have encouraged me during tough times. So, when I finally got the ticket and saw them perform live, it truly felt like a dream come true.

**1. Why do we need to be patient?**

We need to be patient because many good things in life take time. Whether it’s learning a new skill, building a career, or maintaining relationships, patience helps us stay calm and make better decisions instead of acting impulsively.

---

**2. In what situations do we need to be more patient? Why?**

We especially need patience when facing uncertainty or dealing with people. For example, waiting for exam results or handling teamwork conflicts requires patience, because rushing usually leads to mistakes or misunderstandings.

---

**3. Do you think we should be patient all the time?**

Not necessarily. Patience is important, but if we wait too long in situations that require quick action—like solving an emergency or seizing an opportunity—it might become a weakness rather than a virtue.

---

**4. How do people learn to wait?**

People learn to wait mainly through experience. When we realize that being impatient doesn’t change the result, we start to understand the value of waiting. Parents and teachers also play a big role in teaching this lesson through daily routines.

---

**5. Why are some people unwilling to wait?**

Many people are used to instant results nowadays. Technology and social media make everything fast and convenient, so people lose patience easily when things don’t happen immediately. It’s kind of a modern habit.

---

**6. Where do children learn to be patient, at home or at school?**

Both, but home is usually the first place. Parents influence their children’s attitude toward waiting through small things, like taking turns or saving money. Schools then reinforce it by setting deadlines and group projects that require cooperation.

This was not an easy choice because there were many options available, and I wanted to make sure that I would be both interested in the subject and have good career prospects. To make the decision, I **consulted several people**, including my parents, my teachers, and some senior students who were already studying similar fields. My parents shared their experiences and gave me practical advice about job opportunities, while my teachers helped me understand the curriculum and which subjects I might excel at.

### 有用的书

Describe a book you read that you found useful

You should say

what it is

when you read it

why you think it is useful

And explain how you felt about it

---

One book that I read and found really useful is *Atomic Habits* by James Clear. It’s a self-improvement book about how small daily habits can create remarkable results over time.

I read it about a year ago when I was struggling to balance my studies with part-time work. I felt that I was always busy but not productive, so I decided to look for something that could help me improve my work efficiency and achieve a better work-life balance.

I found this book really useful because it provides clear and practical methods. For example, it introduces the “two-minute rule,” which encourages people to start small and make habits easy to begin with. It also emphasizes that being consistent and maintaining balance is far more effective than pushing yourself too hard. After reading it, I started to organize my schedule more wisely and allowed myself proper breaks to recharge.

I felt truly inspired and relieved after applying the ideas from the book. My efficiency improved, and I also felt more relaxed and confident about my daily routine. It’s one of those books that doesn’t just teach theory but actually changes the way you live.

### **社交媒体趣事**

You should say:

One time I saw something really interesting on social media was about a book called *Atomic Habits* by James Clear. I came across a short video about it on Instagram last year when I was scrolling through study-related content.

The video briefly introduced the idea that small daily habits can lead to big changes over time, and it used some real-life examples to show how people became more productive just by sticking to simple routines. I found it quite inspiring because I was struggling to balance my study and part-time work at that time. The creator explained one of the book’s main ideas—the “two-minute rule,” which suggests starting a habit with something so easy that it takes less than two minutes.

I think it was interesting because it wasn’t just a random video—it actually changed the way I think and work. It made me realize how powerful small changes can be, and I still follow some of the tips I learned from that book today.

The sportsperson I really admire is **Li Na**, a retired Chinese tennis player who made history by winning the **French Open** in 2011 and the **Australian Open** in 2014.

I first got to know about her when I was in middle school. At that time, she was already very famous in China because she was the **first Asian player to win a Grand Slam singles title**. I remember watching her matches with my family on TV — the atmosphere was always exciting, especially when she played against top players from around the world.

In real life, Li Na is known for being very **independent, straightforward, and humorous**. She often speaks her mind in interviews and doesn’t try to act perfect, which makes her very real and relatable. She also showed great determination throughout her career, especially when facing injuries and pressure from both media and fans.

Her biggest achievements include her **two Grand Slam titles** and her role in **inspiring a new generation of Asian tennis players**, especially young women who dream of becoming professional athletes.

I admire her not only because of her success on the court but also because of her **strong personality**. She showed that Chinese athletes can also shine on the world stage through confidence and hard work. Her story really motivates me to stay persistent whenever I face challenges in my own life.

One time, I accidentally broke my laptop, which was probably one of the worst experiences I’ve ever had.

It happened about two years ago, when I was working on a school project at home. I was drinking a cup of coffee while typing, and I carelessly knocked the cup over. The coffee spilled all over the keyboard, and the screen suddenly went black. I tried everything I could, like drying it with tissues and even using a hair dryer, but it just wouldn’t turn on again.

I remember feeling really anxious because that laptop contained all my project files, and the deadline was only a few days away. I had to take it to a repair shop immediately, but the technician told me the motherboard was completely damaged and it would cost almost as much as buying a new one. So, in the end, I had to replace it and redo part of my project.

Although it was a terrible experience, it taught me an important lesson about being careful and always backing up my work. Now I never keep drinks near my laptop, and I always store my files in the cloud, just in case something like that happens again.

### **在家族企业工作的人**

You should say:

Who he/she is

---

The person I’d like to talk about is my neighbor, Mr. Li. He works on his family’s small farm, which is located just outside our town. I’ve known him for several years because I often pass by his farm when I go for a walk.

His family has been running this farm for more than twenty years, mainly growing vegetables and some fruit trees. Mr. Li is responsible for most of the daily work — planting, watering, harvesting, and sometimes selling the products in the local market. Even though it seems like tough work, he always looks cheerful and energetic when he’s doing it.

He once told me that what he enjoys most about working on the farm is the sense of freedom and satisfaction it brings. He doesn’t have to sit in an office all day, and he can actually see the results of his hard work — like when the crops grow well or when customers appreciate the fresh produce. He also likes the idea of keeping his family’s tradition alive and staying close to nature.

From him, I’ve learned that enjoying your work doesn’t always mean having a fancy job or earning a lot of money. What really matters is finding meaning and happiness in what you do. His positive attitude towards life has really inspired me to value simple but fulfilling work.

The person I’d like to talk about is my good friend **Leo**, who’s really passionate about outdoor activities, especially hiking. I first met him about three years ago through a hiking club in Shenzhen, and we quickly became close because we share a lot of similar interests.

We’ve known each other for quite a while now, and we’ve done several hiking trips together. One of the most memorable ones was at the **Dongxiyong coastline**, which he actually introduced to me. It’s one of the most beautiful hiking routes in Shenzhen, with amazing mountain and sea views. I remember he planned everything for that trip — from preparing snacks to checking the weather — and he even encouraged me to keep going when I felt tired.

Leo is a really optimistic and energetic person. He loves challenges and always finds joy in nature, which is something I truly admire. He once told me that hiking is not just about exercise, but also about finding peace of mind and learning to appreciate life at a slower pace.

He’s important to me because he’s not only a fun travel companion but also someone who inspires me to stay active and positive. From him, I’ve learned that spending time outdoors can really help me clear my mind and recharge, especially when life in the city gets stressful.

### **想拥有的朋友的好习惯**

Who your friend is

What habit he/she has

When you noticed this habit

And explain why you want to develop this habit

One of my close friends, who’s really into hiking, has a habit that I truly admire and want to develop — he always keeps a very consistent lifestyle no matter how busy he gets. I first noticed this when we went hiking together at the **Dongxiyong coastline** in Shenzhen last year. It’s a quite challenging route, and I was honestly exhausted halfway through, but he still looked full of energy. Later, I realized it’s because he has a habit of exercising every morning and planning his day carefully.

What really impressed me is that he treats this routine almost like a rule — he wakes up early, does some stretching or jogging, and even on weekends, he sticks to it. Because of this, he’s always energetic, focused, and has a really positive attitude toward life.

I really want to develop this habit myself because I often feel that my daily schedule is too random. If I could follow a more consistent routine like his, I’d probably be healthier, more productive, and less stressed. So I’ve started trying to get up earlier and go for short walks in the morning — it’s not easy, but I can already feel the difference.

We started by exchanging greetings in English, and then he asked me where a certain building was located. I explained the way step by step, using simple sentences and gestures to make it easier for him to understand. During our conversation, we also talked a little about the university and the courses he was taking, which made the interaction more natural and friendly.

At first, I felt **a bit nervous**, because I wasn’t sure if my English was clear enough and whether he could understand me. But as we continued talking, I felt **more confident and happy**, especially when he smiled and thanked me. It gave me a sense of accomplishment and made me realize that even a simple conversation can be meaningful when you’re communicating with someone from a different culture.

I shared this dinner with three of my closest friends, who have been supporting me through university life. During the dinner, we talked about funny memories from school, our plans for the upcoming holiday, and even shared some personal challenges we were facing. The atmosphere was really warm and lively, with lots of laughter and joking around.

I really enjoyed this dinner because it wasn’t just about the food — it was about **spending quality time with people I care about** and feeling appreciated on my special day. I felt happy and relaxed, and it gave me a sense of connection and gratitude. Overall, it was a simple yet memorable evening that I’ll always remember.

I first came to know about this field during high school when I attended a science exhibition in my city. There were several interactive demonstrations of robots performing different tasks, and I was immediately fascinated by how machines could be programmed to mimic human actions and make decisions on their own.

Since then, I’ve gathered more information through online articles, educational videos, and even some beginner robotics courses. I’ve also read about the latest developments in AI-powered robots, which can learn and adapt in real-world environments.

I’m interested in robotics because it combines **engineering, computer science, and creativity**, allowing people to solve real-world problems in innovative ways. It also gives me a sense of excitement imagining how robots could help in daily life, healthcare, or even space exploration. Learning more about this field would not only satisfy my curiosity but also potentially open up career opportunities in a cutting-edge area of technology.

She’s incredibly talented at **singing and songwriting**, and she often performs during breaks at school, small gatherings, or university events. I think her greatest achievement so far is how she can **write her own songs and accompany herself with a guitar**, creating music that really connects with people and evokes emotions.

I admire her creativity because she doesn’t just follow popular trends — she adds her own style and emotions to every performance.

I’d like to talk about a time when I received really good service from a staff member in a shop. It happened about half a year ago at an **electronics store** near my university, where I went to buy a pair of **wireless earbuds**.

When I got there, I wasn’t sure which model to choose because there were so many options with different prices and functions. A staff member noticed that I looked a bit confused, so he came over and **politely asked if I needed help**. He patiently explained the differences between several models — like sound quality, battery life, and noise-cancelling performance — and even let me test them myself.

What impressed me most was that he didn’t just try to sell the most expensive one. Instead, he recommended a mid-range model that suited my needs and budget. He also showed me how to pair it with my phone and gave me some tips for maintenance.

I felt really satisfied with the service because it was **professional, friendly, and honest**. It made my shopping experience smooth and enjoyable, and I left the store feeling that I had made a smart purchase. That experience also gave me a good impression of the store, and I’ve been back there several times since then.

I’d like to talk about a time when the electricity suddenly went off in my apartment. It happened **last summer**, during a really hot evening. I was at home studying for my final exams when, all of a sudden, the lights went out, my fan stopped working, and the whole place went completely silent.

At first, I thought it was just my room, but when I looked outside, I realized the **entire neighborhood was in darkness**. It turned out that there was a power failure caused by heavy rain and strong wind. The outage lasted for **around three hours**, which felt like forever, especially because it was so hot and humid.

During that time, I couldn’t use my computer or phone for long since I wanted to save the battery. So I ended up **sitting on the balcony with a few neighbors**, chatting and enjoying the cool breeze. Someone even brought some candles, which made the scene surprisingly cozy.

Although it was inconvenient at first, I actually **enjoyed the quiet moment** without screens or noise. It gave me a rare chance to relax and connect with people around me. When the power finally came back, I felt relieved but also a bit nostalgic for that peaceful atmosphere.
