# 图表类

## 段落

### 段落组成

固定包含四段

- **第一段：改写段**
对图表介绍进行复述、同义改写，1~2 句话，题目中图表介绍是几句话就写成几句话
- **第二段：Overview 段**
2~3 句话，2~3 个要点，包含宏观信息，“看型”不能碰任何具体数值，引导词：**Overall, In sum**
- **第三段和第四段：Detail 段**
各 4~5 句话 main features，需要描述微观信息，注意把具有相似性的内容分为一组，共两组

---

具体细节

### 改写段

改写规则

- 换词（占 ≤20%）
    
    the graph → 更具体的类型
    
    shows → illustrates, compares, displays
    
    proportion → percentage
    
    information → data
    
    number → figure
    
    types → categories
    
    trends → changes
    
- 换位置（1~2组）
    
    后置定语 → 前置修饰语
    
    句中状语 → 句前/句末状语
    
- 概括
    
    国家名 → three countries
    
    时间 → three years between... and.
    

注：如果题目中对两张图表有两句话介绍，则分别改写这两句话

### Overview 段

包含宏观信息，**“看型”** 而 **不能碰任何具体数值**

- 例一（line graph 动态图）
    
    ![image.png](小作文/image.png)
    
    看型：左宽右窄，两升两降
    
    注：过去的时间点，一般过去时即可
    
    左宽右窄：**In sum**, there was a large gap between the numbers for each city in August, while by December, the difference narrowed.
    
    两升两降：Between August and December, New York and Miami had a general decline in household water use per person, whereas Seattle and Atlanta saw an increase.
    
- 例二（bar chart 静态图）
    
    ![image.png](小作文/image 1.png)
    
    看型：灰高于黑、右高于左
    
    注：这是静态图，不能用描述数据趋势的表达（随着……越来越……）
    
    ① 灰高于黑：**Overall**, the proportion of women with more than one chronic disease was lower than that of men in the same age group.
    
    ② 右高于左：**Also**, older people were at a higher risk of developing chronic diseases than younger people.
    
- 例三（pie chart 动态图）
    
    ![image.png](小作文/image 2.png)
    
    **In sum**, the percentage of students at this university who participate in two other clubs remained stable over the two years.
    
    选择 Two other clubs 的学生比例在两个年份中是相对稳定的。
    
    There have been changes in the percentage of students opting for other clubs or none at all.
    
    选择其他 Clubs 或没有选择任何 Clubs 的学生比例在两个年份中都有一定的变化。
    
- 例四（table 静态图）
    
    ![image.png](小作文/image 3.png)
    
    > **看型**而不能碰任何具体的数值
    > 
    
    **Overall**, for these five countries, the proportion of consumption on food and drinks is the largest; the smallest part, on the contrary, is on leisure.
    
    五个国家在 Food and Drinks 上消费占比都是最大的；而在 Leisure 方面的消费最小
    

### **Detail 段**

**对数**

- 所有 main features 的准确数值
- 极值/等值，起点/终点，最高点/最低点，升幅/降幅

通过把具有相似性的内容分为一组，将细节性信息分成 2 组 → 两个 detail 段

细节段的划分方式（如何划分两个段落）：

- **时间维度**
    
    10 月之前如何，10 月之后如何
    
    ![image.png](小作文/image 4.png)
    
- **排名纬度**
    
    描述中美两国的情况，描述其余国家（3~10）的情况
    
    ![image.png](小作文/image 5.png)
    
- 比较对象本身特点
    
    ![image.png](小作文/image 6.png)
    
- 比较对象纬度特点
    
    两个比较的维度 ① 性别 ② 年龄段
    
    ① 男性内部不同年龄段的对比；女性内部也是如此
    
    ② 每一个年龄段，男性与女性之间的交叉对比
    
    ![image.png](小作文/image 7.png)
    
- 图表均有的题目
    
    一张图/表对应一个 detail 段 → 恰好两个 detail 段
    

**细节段引导词**

- As for X … Concerning Y …
- As shown in the first chart … As shown in the second chart …
- According to the … Based on the …
- Similarly, Likewise, By contrast, By comparison, On the other hand

## **注意事项**

### 时态

一般：混用多种时态

- 对图表的整体描述 → 一般现在时 the line graph illustrates ...
- 对图表的数据描述 → 数据发生的具体时间
    - 已发生 / 正在进行 / 即将上演 →  一过 / 一现 / 一将
- 趋势（到某个时间点为止，某数据的状态一直是）：完成进行时
    - 过去：过去完成进行时 had been doing
    某个数据直到 1999 年为止一直是上升的
    The figure **had been increasing** steadily till **1999**.
    - 现在：现在完成进行时 have been doing
    某个数据到现在为止一直是上升的
    The figure **has been growing** steadily by **now**.

注：若图表中没有任何具体时间 → 一现

### **逻辑连接词**

要求客观，不能主观：因果✗ 举例✗  递进✓  类比✓  转折✓  对比✓

并列关系: in addition, moreover, furthermore...

类比关系: similarly, likewise...

转折/对比关系: while, whereas, on the other hand, by contrast, on the contrary, but, however...

### 数据对象词

数据对象词指的是表达数据主观内容的词

对数据对象词的简化方法（必须保证数据对象词的**核心词**不变）：

- 省略：可省略修饰语，但必须保留核心词
- 指代：This/That/These/Those… 替代，指代必须指向核心词
- 例子：平均车辆二氧化碳排放量
    
    下图呈现了五个国家在 1990 年和 2000 年之间，平均每一个车辆的二氧化碳排放量。
    
    The graph below shows average carbon dioxide (CO₂) emissions per vehicle…
    
    限定修饰语：average carbon dioxide … per vehicle
    
    **核心词：emissions**
    
    ---
    
    描述：英国 1990 年的 X 是大于日本1990年的 X 的
    
    ✓ The average carbon dioxide emissions per vehicle in the UK in 1990 were greater than the average carbon dioxide emissions per vehicle in Japan.
    
    ✗ The average carbon dioxide emissions per vehicle in the UK in 1990 were greater than Japan.
    
    ✓ The average carbon dioxide emissions per vehicle in the UK in 1990 were greater than those in Japan.
    
    ---
    
    描述：英国平均每一个车辆的二氧化碳排放量在上升
    
    The average carbon dioxide emissions per vehicle in the UK steadily increased.
    
    描述：日本平均每一个车辆的二氧化碳排放量在下降
    
    省略（要保留核心词）
    
    The emissions in Japan steadily decreased.
    
    指代（指向核心词）（注 emissions 本身是复数，但是其数量是一个单数）
    
    Those of Japan steadily decreased.
    
    This figure for Japan steadily decreased.
    

## **高分要点**

### **语言使用**

如何从语言组织方面，提升整体图表类“小作文”写作质量

上升趋势

- 上升： rise = increase = grow = climb = jump = skyrocket
- 轻微上升: a slight increase = increase slightly
- 迅速上升: rapid growth = increase more rapidly
- 显著上升: a dramatic increase = increase dramatically
- 匀速上升: increase uniformly = increase constantly
- 持续上升: increase continuously
- 小增长: see a small rise to
- 涨到峰值: climb to its peak at = reach its peak at

下降趋势:

- 下降： decrease = decline = fall = drop = slide = plummet
- 轻微下降: a slight decrease = decrease slightly
- 显著下降: a significant decline = decline noticeably
- 持续下降: fall consistently
- 骤降: plummet to
- 呈现下降趋势: witness a downward trend

稳定趋势:

- 无变化: remain
- 保持: remain stable = steady = constant = uncharged
- ... remained relatively stable = remain uncharged at around... 相对保持稳定
- There is relatively little change in the figure for... ……的数字变化较小
- The number of A remained steady/stable from (month/year) to (month/year). ……月(年)至……月(年)的数量基本不变
- The percentage of A stayed the same between...and... ……至……期间 A 的比率维持不变

### **内容组织**

内容组织即“结合”，将 2~3 个要点结合成一个 主句 + 辅句

具体四种方法

- 前后结合：先描述数据的前一部分，再描述后一部分
    - 纽约的人均用水量，从8月的290加仑降至11月的275加仑，然后在后续时间里，一直稳定在这个水平上。
    - The average household water use per person in New York saw a decrease from 290 gallons in August to about 275 gallons in November, and this figure remained at such a lower level in the rest of the period.
- 动静结合：静（数据点）动（数据的前后变化，即动态的趋势）
    - 在迈阿密，虽然人均用水量，在10月达到了第二次高峰（超过270加仑），但是，这个数据随后经历了连续两个月的下降。
    - In Miami, the average household water use per person reached a second peak in October with slightly over 270 gallons, but this figure recorded a two consecutive months of decline thereafter.
- 文理结合：文（给出评价）理（给出数值本身）
    - 亚特兰大是最节省用水的城市，人均用水量的最高值不超过240加仑。
    - Atlanta has been ranked as the most water-efficient city for households, with a maximum value of no more than 240 gallons.
- 宏微结合：微观片段 → 将数据放在宏观整体下比较
    - 西雅图人均用水量，从8月的235加仑增长至12月275加仑，从第三名升至第一名。
    - The average household water use per person in Seattle increased from 235 gallons in August to 275 gallons in December, moving from one of the two lowest to the number one city.

The two diagrams show the soybean growth stages and the steps in the production of soy milk.

![image.png](小作文/image 11.png)

> 第一段
> 

The two diagrams illustrate stages of soybean growth and the production of soy milk, respectively.

> 第二段 第一张图：植物生长过程图，主动，一现
> 

During the growth of soybeans, first, after the soybean seeds are placed in the soil, they grow into sprouts in about 2 weeks.

在黄豆的生长过程中，首先黄豆种子在2周左右会长成树芽。

In the next phase, the sprouts gradually produce more leaves and flowers, which then transform into pods.

接着，树芽会逐渐长出更多的叶子并开花，然后花会逐渐接成豆荚。

The entire process of transitioning from sprout to pod takes about 4 weeks.

从树芽到结出豆荚的过程大约需要4周左右的时间。

Entering the final phase, the pods mature in 2 weeks and yield soybeans.

豆荚经过2周成熟后得到黄豆。

> 第三段 第二张图：工序流程图，被动，一现
> 

In the process of making soy milk, soybeans are first soaked in water for about 6 hours, and then the soaked soybeans are grounded, from which the raw soy milk is obtained.

在豆浆的制作过程中，黄豆会首先被浸泡在水中6小时左右，然后浸泡后的黄豆会被研磨并得到生豆浆。

Notably, the ground soybean residue left over from this process can be used to feed livestock.

研磨后的豆渣可以用来饲养牲畜。

Next, the raw soy milk is heated to 180 degrees to ensure sterilization.

接着，生豆浆会被加热至180度进行消毒。

In the final stage, the soy milk is bottled and packaged for distribution.

最后，豆浆会被装罐并打包。

> 第四段 总结
> 

In total, it takes 6 phases (about 8 weeks) to grow soybeans, while the soy milk production process is much faster, requiring only 4 steps.

    The first table below shows changes in the total population of New York City from 1800 to 2000. The second and third tables show changes in the population of the five districts of the city (Manhattan, Brooklyn, Bronx, Queens, Staten Island) over the same period.
    
    Summarise the information by selecting and reporting the main features, and make comparisons where relevant.
    
    ![image.png](小作文/image 13.png)
    
    The first table given demonstrates how the population in New York City has changed between the period of 1800 and 2000, and the second and third tables illustrate how the populations of five districts in the city have altered as a percentage of the entire population throughout this period.
    
    Overall, the total population of New York City has grown significantly from 1800 to 2000. As regards the changes in population in the five districts, Manhattan's population has fallen in proportion to the entire population in response to the growth in the ratio of the four other districts (Brooklyn, Bronx, Queens, and Staten Island).
    
    The population in New York City has grown from a little under 80,000 to 8 million in 200 years. Manhattan used to be the most populated district of the city, whose residents took up 76% of the entire city's population in 1800. Although Manhattan's population tripled in the next hundred years, its percentage of the city's population fell, as population in other districts also dramatically increased between 1800 and 1900. In 1900, Manhattan and other districts were nearly one-to-one. In 2000, Manhattan's percentage dropped to below 20% as its number of residents also fell significantly. By contrast, the number of people residing in other districts continued to climb in 2000, and the population in other districts finally comprised 81% of the entire city's population.

    The plans below show the site of a farm in 1950 and the same site today.
    
    Summarise the information by selecting and reporting the main features, and make comparisons where relevant.
    
    ![image.png](小作文/image 14.png)
    
    The two maps illustrate how Beechwood Farm has changed from 1950 to the present day.
    
    In 1950, a track ran through the middle of the farm. To the north of the track was a large field for sheep, while the southern part of the farm contained most of the facilities. Fruit trees were located close to the main road, followed by areas for soft fruits and vegetables extending towards the river. Further away from the main road stood a barn, a farmhouse, and an enclosed area for chickens, all surrounded by the river on one side.
    
    Today, the track has been converted into a road, and the area once used for sheep has been replaced by a camping field, solar panels, and two parking areas. The barn has been relocated to the junction of two roads, with holiday cottages built on its former site. Additionally, a farm shop has been constructed among the fruit trees.

    The diagram given illustrates the process of producing fabric from bamboo.
    
    Overall, there are eight stages in the process, beginning with planting the bamboo in spring and harvesting it in autumn, and ending with weaving it to produce fabric, which can be made into clothes.
    
    First, bamboo plants need to be planted in the spring. In autumn, the grown bamboo would be harvested by farmers and cut into strips by a special machine. The strips are then crushed to make liquid pulp. In the next stage, the liquid pulp needs to be filtered to separate any long fibres from the liquid, which is a crucial stage in the production of bamboo fabric. When this is done, the fibres are softened by a mixture of water and amine oxide. A spinning process comes next to make yarn, and finally, the yarn is woven into fabric, which can be used for manufacturing clothes.

    The two maps illustrate the changes in Porth Harbour, comparing its layout in the year 2000 to its current state.
    
    In 2000, the harbour was situated along the main road, with two western parking lots connecting different roads. Utilized for basic amenities and areas for fishing boats and private yachts, Porth Harbour had two public beaches on the east side. The northern beach was adjacent to a dock where passenger ferries stopped, while the southern beach was near a disused castle and lifeboat station.
    
    In stark contrast, the present-day harbour has seen notable development, particularly in its commercial and recreational facilities. On the west side, both parking lots are accessible from the main road, and additional showers and toilets have been built between them. Adjacent to them, the area for marinas and fishing boats has been repositioned. With the construction of cafes and shops near the lifeboat station, the southern coast now features a new bypass leading to a newly built hotel, which has acquired the southern beach for commercial use, replacing the castle. Furthermore, a new dock has been built next to the existing one, enhancing the harbour’s capability.
    
    Overall, Porth Harbour has experienced significant development over the past two decades, evident in its expanded commercial facilities for tourists. There has also been an alteration in the utilization of different areas, as the southern part is now used privately.

    The given flow chart depicts the production cycle of ethanol, a biofuel.
    
    Overall, this production process encompasses eight stages, which start with the cultivation of plants and trees and culminate in the supply of the generated ethanol to vehicles. Notably, the carbon dioxide released by the traffic can be utilised to promote the growth of the plants, effectively closing the whole cycle.
    
    Initially, sunlight and carbon dioxide serve as the primary energy sources for the growth of cultivated trees and plants. Upon reaching maturity, these plants are harvested using professional agricultural machinery and then pre-processed to produce cellulose.
    
    The remaining steps mainly involve the raw cellulose, through a series of transformations, is extracted to generate sugars that are subsequently fermented by the addition of microbes, yielding ethanol. Afterwards, this produced bio-energy will be used to power vehicles, including cars, planes, and trucks. The carbon dioxide released during the combustion of ethanol is then absorbed by the plants, completing the cycle.
